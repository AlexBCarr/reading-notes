## What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?
- Equality - equal voices, equal input and equal work share.
- Comfortability - one can not over look the power of a free flowing mind.
- Empowerment - speak up it is always the quiet ones with the great ideas. 

## Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.
- While in the military I was faced with psychological issues often. While Divisional Leading Petty Officer of one division I noticed in another division there was a sailor behaving quite strang. I told the rest of the chain of command so we could get him evaluated. Medical sent him back and said he was fit for full duty, however, I still did not feel right. While on my way to talk to the sailor on a more person level I heard a man down call. I reached him on the ground and a crowd around him. He had taken a mouth full of pills. There was clearly an issue with him and mmost people walked right by. He is ok by the way.

## What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?
- This plays a major role in companies today. So much about what we do when we clock in on a daily basis rely on a team collaboration of some sort, very few jobs you strictly work alone. So with teamwork being the backbone of most companies if the psychological awareness of the team is high them the company will follow suit. Positive environment yells successful business.
