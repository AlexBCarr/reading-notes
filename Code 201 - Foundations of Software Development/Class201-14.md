## CSS Transforms
- Allows you to change element into two/three-dimensional.

## CSS Transitions & Animations
- With CSS transitions you have the potential to alter the appearance of an element whenever a state chane occurs.
- This is when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.
- Transitions provide a change from one state to another, while animations can set multiple points of transition upon different keyframes.

## Transition Lifestyle

- Transitions gives the user something for their eyes to focus on.
- Provides that pop effect with colors, fades and rotations.
