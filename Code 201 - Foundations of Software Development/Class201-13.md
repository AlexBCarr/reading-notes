# STORAGE

## Local Storage
- Storing information locally on a user’s computer is a powerful strategy for a developer who is creating something for the Web.
- Problem with HTTP as the main transport layer of the Web is that it is stateless. 
- So when you use an application and then close it, its state will be reset the next time you open it. If you close an application on your desktop and re-open it, its most recent state is restored.


## Cookies
- Cookies were invented early in the web’s history, and indeed they can be used for persistent local storage of small amounts of data. But they have three potentially dealbreaking downsides:
  - Cookies are included with every HTTP request, thereby slowing down your web application by needlessly transmitting the same data over and over
  - Cookies are included with every HTTP request, thereby sending data unencrypted over the internet (unless your entire web application is served over SSL)
  - Cookies are limited to about 4 KB of data — enough to slow down your application (see above), but not enough to be terribly useful
