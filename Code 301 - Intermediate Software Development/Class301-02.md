# State and Props

## React Lifecycle
- Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?
***render***
- What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?
***Mounting***
- Put the following things in the order that they happen: componentDidMount, render, constructor, componentWillUnmount, React Updates
***constructor, render, React Updates,componentDidMount and componentWillUnmount***
- What does componentDidMount do?
***This method is invoked immediately after a component is mounted. If you need to load anything using a network request or initialize the DOM, it should go here. This method is a good place to set up any subscriptions***

## React State Vs props
- What types of things can you pass in the props?
***data***
- What is the big difference between props and state?
***Big difference between props are arguments or data passed into a component, handled/must be updated outside the componenet. state is handled/must be updated inside that component ***
- When do we re-render our application?
***When the state is changed inside of the application it will re-render that portion of your application***
- What are some examples of things that we could store in state?
***State will be used when you want to re-render and/or update your application. Also store items of a form***
