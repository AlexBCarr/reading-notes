# React and Forms

## Forms

- What is a ‘Controlled Component’?
**A JavaScript function that handles the submission of the form and has access to the data that the user entered into the form.** 

- Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.
**When they submit the form, because upon submit is the only time state would acutally need to be updated.**

- How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?
**The event handler is only there to verify things have changed not what it actually changed too**


## The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained

- Why would we use a ternary operator?
**We can display the contents on the basis of one condition where everything depends on the condition true and false we can put the contents on the conditional basis.**


- Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:

if(x===y){
  console.log(true);
} else {
  console.log(false);
}

**x===y ? 'true' : 'false'**
