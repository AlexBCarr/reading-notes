# Passing Functions as Props

## React Docs - Lists and Keys

- What does .map() return? **a new array**

- If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React? **map()**

- Each list item needs a unique **key**

- What is the purpose of a key? **Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity**

## The Spread Operator

- What is the spread operator? **A useful and quick syntax for adding items to arrays, combinding arrays or objects, and spreading an array out into a function's arguments.**

- List 4 things that the spread operator can do. **Copying an array, Concatenating or combining arrays, Using Math functions, Using an array as arguments, Adding an item to a list, Adding to state in React, Combining objects, Converting NodeList to an array.**

- Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.

const myArray = [`🤪`,`🐻`,`🎌`]
const yourArray = [`🙂`,`🤗`,`🤩`]
const ourArray = [...myArray,...yourArray]
console.log(...ourArray) // 🤪 🐻 🎌 🙂 🤗 🤩

- Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.

const fewFruit = ['🍏','🍊','🍌']
const fewMoreFruit = ['🍉', '🍍', ...fewFruit]
console.log(fewMoreFruit) //  Array(5) [ "🍉", "🍍", "🍏", "🍊", "🍌" ]

- Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.

const objectOne = {hello: "🤪"}
const objectTwo = {world: "🐻"}
const objectThree = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: "😂"}
console.log(objectThree) // Object { hello: "🤪", world: "🐻", laugh: "😂" }
const objectFour = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: () => {console.log("😂".repeat(5))}}
objectFour.laugh() // 😂😂😂😂😂
