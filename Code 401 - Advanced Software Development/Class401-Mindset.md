## My Preparations

1. The first that I always try to do, better yet try not to do is intimidate my-self internally. So many people lose before they even attempt with thoughts of not being able to do the task or worrying about how they will be perceived. You have to go into all things with an optimistic mindset of having the confidence that you will do whatever it takes for completion. My next topic is what allows you to do this with the correct tools.

2. PRACTICE! Practice gives us all the confidence we need to succeed. Not only does practice allows me the chance to go over my prepared work for errors and memorization it also allows me the time to perfect the craft. repetition is and always has been the key to success for me, my brain needs it for storage.
