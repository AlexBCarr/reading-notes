# Engineering Readings

1. What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?
- I have a burning passion for succeeding. Not for the typical reason of just being successful. I have seen what a strugling family can look like first hand, so everyday I reach for greatness for my families well being and shelter. 



2. What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?
- It is ok to ask a peer. I am so used to not wanting to bother others, that I would rather struggle through an issue on my own rather than reach out to a peer. This will change.
