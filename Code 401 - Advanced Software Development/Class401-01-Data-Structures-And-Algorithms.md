# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Data Structures

1. What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?
- The Big O Notation - is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function.
- Or simiply the complexity of your code using algebraic terms.


2. How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?
- you must have a base case where the function stops make new recursive calls.
