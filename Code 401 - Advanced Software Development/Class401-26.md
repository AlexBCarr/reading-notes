## Android Fundamentals

1. What is an Intent in Android Studios? Give some fresh examples of when you might use it.
- An Intent in Android Studios is an object that is used to communicate with the Android system, other applications, or components such as activities, services, and broadcast receivers. It's like a messenger that passes information between different parts of an app or between different apps.
  1. Opening a new activity - When a button is clicked in one activity, an Intent can be used to start a new activity, passing any necessary data between them.
  2. Sending a broadcast message - An Intent can be used to send a broadcast message to the system or to other apps, allowing developers to listen for specific messages and trigger specific actions.
  3. Calling or messaging a contact - An Intent can be used to initiate a call or message to a specific contact in the user's contact list.

2. Describe an Activity in your own word.
- An activity in Android Studio can be described as a visual component or screen that interacts with the user. It contains a layout and is responsible for presenting information to the user and receiving input from them.
