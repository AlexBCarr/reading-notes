# GraphQL

1. Describe asynchronous actions in your own words.
- Asynchronous actions are a way to handle non-blocking operations that need to be performed in a GraphQL query or mutation. This means that instead of waiting for the operation to complete before moving to the next step, GraphQL can continue to execute other tasks while the non-blocking operation is processing.

2. What is the benefit of asynchronous methods?
  1. Improved performance: Asynchronous programming  allows multiple operations to be executed simultaneously, leading to faster response times.

  2. Better resource utilization: With asynchronous methods, resources can be utilized more efficiently, as tasks can be delegated to different threads or processes.

  3. Scalability: Asynchronous programming allows applications to be scaled more easily, as it facilitates the creation of concurrent processes that can handle more requests.

  4. Avoiding blocking calls: Asynchronous methods allow developers to avoid blocking calls, where the application waits for a response from a database or API before continuing. This can prevent the application from becoming unresponsive or crashing.

  5. Better user experience: With faster response times and improved resource utilization, asynchronous methods can lead to a better user experience by reducing latency and improving application responsiveness.
