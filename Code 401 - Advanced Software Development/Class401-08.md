# Rule of Three

## Understanding

1. Are there any projects that youâ€™ve built during your time at Code Fellows (or prior) which could benefit from applying the Rule of Three to DRY up your code?
- Yes 

2. Explain how you would dry up your code if you noticed that you are repeating the same logic in multiple places?
- I would see if I could turn the piece of code into a function or method to be called for later.

## MVP

1. Describe some benefits of releasing an MVP of a product.
- The MVP gives you a steady goal to work toward that satisfies all of the clients bottomline needs.
- This allows you to stay focus with minimal interuptions. 
- This gives the client something to look forward to and they dont feel left out or left wondering.

2. What are some potential pitfalls of waiting until a product is fully mature to release it.
- Client grows antsy.
- Client may want to change something so its nice to check in.
- You are not showing your boss or the client progression.
