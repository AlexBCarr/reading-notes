# Functional Programing

1. Can you change the state of a data structure using functional programming?
- No

2. Define purely functional programming.
-  It emphasizes the use of pure functions that don't have side effects and always return the same output for a given input.

3. How do you think purely functional programming will differ from the programs youâ€™ve written so far in this course?
- This can make code easier to analyze, test and also maintain.
