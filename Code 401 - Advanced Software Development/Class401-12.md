# Accessing Data

## Accesssing Data with JPA

1. How are query methods defined when using Spring Data JPA?
- The Spring Data JPA framework implements these query methods during an application startup. Based on the name, return type, and arguments of the query methods, Spring generates an SQL query and related JDBC code behind the scene

2. Which dependencies will you need in order to complete the Spring guide?
- org.springframework.boot
- spring-boot-starter 

3. What annotations are used to specify an auto generated identification number for an Entity?
- Primary Key Generation Using Oracle's Sequence


## Comparing repositories 

1. Which of the Spring Data Repositories covered in the readings has the most methods available to it?
- JpaRepository

2. Name a downside of a Spring Data Repository.
- we couple our code to the library and to its specific abstractions, such as Page or Pageable; that's of course not unique to this library â€“ but we do have to be careful not to expose these internal implementation details

3. How would you define an operation to find a student based on their name in a repo named StudentRepository which extends JpaRepository?
- You can simply define an abstract method List<Student> findAll() in the StudentRepository interface.
