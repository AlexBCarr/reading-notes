## Android Shared Preferences

1. What is a technology youâ€™ve used before that is similar to Shared Preferences?
-  I have not used any technology like Shared Preferences. However, a technology that is similar to Shared Preferences is "UserDefaults" in iOS, which is a simple way to store small amounts of data locally on a device. It works in a similar way as Shared Preferences, where data is stored in key-value pairs, and can be easily accessed and modified.

2. Why is testing important? Give at least 4 reasons, and explain which is the most important to you and why.
- The most important reason for me is finding defects and issues.
  1. Finding defects and issues: Testing allows us to identify defects and issues that may affect the functionality, usability, and accessibility of software. It helps us to fix them before releasing the product to the end-users.
  2. Ensuring Quality: Testing helps to ensure product quality. It confirms that the software meets the requirement specification, performs the intended functions, and provides value to the business or customers.
  3. Enhancing User Experience: Through testing, developers can evaluate the user experience of the software. It allows them to make necessary changes and developments to enhance the overall user experience.
  4. Reducing Risks and Costs: Testing helps to reduce the risks and costs associated with software development. It minimizes the chances of making costly errors and mistakes that may arise from deploying an untested or faulty software solution.

3. Create an analogy for Tasks and the back stack. Have we used a similar system before? Explain.
  - Tasks and the back stack of an app can be compared to a stack of papers on a desk. Just like how the papers are placed on top of each other in a specific order, tasks are added to the back stack in the order in which they are opened.

  When a person needs to work on a specific paper, they take it from the top of the stack, just like how the user interacts with the task at the top of the back stack in an app. Similarly, when a person completes working on one paper, they place it at the bottom of the stack, just like how the completed task is pushed to the bottom of the back stack.

  This system of organizing tasks is similar to the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) system used in inventory management and accounting, where the last items added are the first items to be removed.
