# Intro to password hashing

1. Define the term “hashing”.
- Defined as the process of transforming one value into another based on a particular key.

2. Explain to a non-technical friend what a hash function does to a password.
- a mathematical function that converts any digital data into an output string with a fixed number of characters.

## bcrypt overview

1. What does it mean to ‘salt’ a password?
-  a technique to protect passwords stored in databases by adding a string of 32 or more characters and then hashing them.

2. What piece of information would a hacker need to access in order to find the ‘salt’ string for your passwords?
- secret key

## jBCrypt

1. How does the Blowfish block cipher handle the increased computation speed of new computers?
- The Blowfish algorithm also has a lesser amount of operations to complete compared to other encryption algorithms.

2. What are the issue with the two most commong password hashes for Java (“Java password hash” and “Java password encryption”)?
- both offer terrible advice: one uses an unsalted hash which allows reverse dictionary lookup of passwords and the other recommends reversible encryption, which is rarely needed and should only be used as a last resort.
