## Spring Security Overview

1. What does it mean to authenticate a user?
- Authentication is the process of identifying users that request access to a system, network, or device.

2. What does it mean to authorize a user?
- Authorization is the process of giving the user permission to access a specific resource or function.

3. What are the three possible outcomes of the AuthenticationManagerâ€™s authenticate() method?
- Return an Authentication (normally with authenticated=true) if it can verify that the input represents a valid principal.
- Throw an AuthenticationException if it believes that the input represents an invalid principal.
- Return null if it cannot decide.
