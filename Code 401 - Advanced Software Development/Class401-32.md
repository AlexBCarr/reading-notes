# GraphQL

1. What makes an API RESTful?
  - Client-Server Architecture: The API must follow a client-server architecture where clients and servers are separated and can evolve independently.

  - Statelessness: The API must be stateless, meaning that each request from the client to the server must contain all the necessary information to complete the request. The server should not keep track of any client context between requests.

  -  Uniform Interface: The API must have a uniform interface, which means that all resources are accessed in the same way using standard HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

  - Resource identification through URI: Each resource in the API must be uniquely identified by a URI (uniform resource identifier).

  - Representation-oriented: The API should be representation-oriented where the representation of a resource is separate from the resource itself and can be accessed in a variety of formats such as JSON, XML, or HTML.

  - Cacheability: Responses from the API should be cacheable, allowing for faster access to frequently requested data.

2. What is the benefit of using GraphQL? Any downsides?

  - Efficient data retrieval: With GraphQL, you can retrieve only the data that you need. This reduces the amount of unnecessary data transfer and makes the application faster.

  - Single endpoint: GraphQL offers a single endpoint for accessing different types of resources. This simplifies the codebase, reduces the number of API endpoints, and makes it easier to maintain.

  - Type safety: GraphQL provides a schema definition that makes it easier to understand the data structure of the API. This makes it easier to write code and reduces errors.

  - Client-driven data retrieval: With GraphQL, the client is in control of the data retrieval process. Clients can specify the exact fields and relations they need, which results in a more efficient data retrieval process.

  - Tooling support: GraphQL comes with excellent tooling support, such as GraphiQL, which makes it easier to test and explore the API.

  **Downsides of using GraphQL:**

  - Complexity: The flexibility of GraphQL makes it more complex than RESTful APIs. It requires different expertise and infrastructure to set up and maintain.

  - Caching: Caching with GraphQL is not as straightforward as with RESTful APIs. The dynamic nature of GraphQL queries means that caching requires more effort.

  - Learning curve: Developers need to learn new concepts and skills to work with GraphQL. This can take time and resources to train teams.

  - Limited tooling: Although GraphQL has excellent tooling support, there are fewer tools and libraries available compared to RESTful APIs.

3. Describe “serverless” to a new 301 Code Fellows student.
- Serverless is a cloud-native development model that allows developers to build and run applications without having to manage servers. There are still servers in serverless, but they are abstracted away from app development
