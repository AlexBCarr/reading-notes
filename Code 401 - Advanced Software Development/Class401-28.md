## RecyclerView For Displaying Lists of Data

1. What makes a RecyclerView dynamic?
- A RecyclerView is dynamic because it can adapt to changes in its data source and display the updated content to the user. This means that if the data changes (such as adding or removing items), the RecyclerView can update its layout accordingly. It also supports a variety of layout managers, which can be used to display items in a grid, staggered grid, or list format. Additionally, RecyclerView supports smooth scrolling and view recycling, which makes it more efficient than other similar views like ListView.
