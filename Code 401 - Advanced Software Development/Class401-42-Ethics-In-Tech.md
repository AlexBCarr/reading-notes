# Ethics In Tech


## Ethics in the workplace

1. Google and AI
- This was very interesting to me that a big company could get caught doing this kind of thing, even if you are innocent there had to be some red flags to alert people of some wrong doing. AI is already a very powerful souce utilized in our everyday lives. But for it to be used in an negative manner such as this, gives all the critics a valid reason to hate what AI seems to be on the road to. Eventually AI will be a huge part in everones life so it is important that we do the right things from the beginning and set strong foundations. I personally can see the endless things that AI will eventually have it's hand in so it is only right to start the wave the right way.


## Ethics in Technology

1. the ethical dilemmas of self-driving cars
- I am not going to lie, I am not a fan! I will never allow a car to drive me, I get nervous when other people are driving me around. I guess to me it is more of a putting my life in others hands. Now I am aware of the future of AI and how it has evolved, I am just not ready to trust it with my life. I actually have a Tesla and my Wife uses the auto pilot all the time when she goes to work, but not me and honestly dont plan on it. Sorry for the rant it is just hard for me to give that much responsibilty to AI.
