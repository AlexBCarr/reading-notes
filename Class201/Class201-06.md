# JavaScript Object Basics

## Object Basics
- An object is a collection of related data and/or functionality
- Usually consist of several variables.
**Dot Notation**
- How to access the object's properties and methods.
- The object name (person) acts as the ***namespace*** - it must be entered first to access anything inside the object.

**Bracket Notation**
- Provides an alternative way to access object properties.

## Introduction to the DOM
- The Document Object Model (DOM) 
- is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web.
- programming interface for web documents

##  DOM and JavaScript 
- it is writtenin JavaScript, but uses the DOM to access the document and its elements.
- DOM is not part of the JavaScript language, but instead a Web API used to build websites.
 **You dont have to do anything special to begin using the DOM. You use the API directly in JavaScript from within what is called a ***scrript***, a program run by a browser.**
