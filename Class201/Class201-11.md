# Audio, Video, Images

## Video and Audio content
- Can be rendered with these element tags:
- <video> -allows you to embed a video very easily. 
- Ex. <video src="rabbit320.webcam" controls>
  - controls are to assist the user in control video and audio playback. control must be used as attribute to include the brower's own control interface, or build your interface using the appropriate JavaScript API.
- <audio> - works just like video element.
- This takes up less space than a video player, as there is no visual component, you just need to display controls to play the audio. 
- Also does not support width/height attributes.

## CSS Grid
- Is a two-dimensional grid-based layout system that, compared to any web layout system of the past, completely changes the way we design user interfaces.
- **Flexbox** is also a very great layout tool, but its one-direction flow has different use cases.
- Define a container element as a grid with **display: grid**
- Set column and row sizes with **grid-template-columns** and **grid-template-rows.**
- Then place child elements into grid with **grid-column** and **grid-row.**

## Responsive Images
- Images that work well on devices with widely differing screen sizes, rsolutions, and other such features.
- Make responsize by adding two attributes: **srcset** and **sizes**.
<img
  srcset="elva-fairy-480w.jpg 480w, elva-fairy-800w.jpg 800w"
  sizes="(max-width: 600px) 480px,
         800px"
  src="elva-fairy-800w.jpg"
  alt="Elva dressed as a fairy" />
